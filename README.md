# Titanic MLOps Project

Welcome to the Titanic MLOps Project! This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of deploying a machine learning model using MLOps practices. The goal is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various features such as age, gender, and class.

## Project Overview

This project includes the following components:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the Titanic dataset for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Building and training a machine learning model to predict survival.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model using various metrics.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the trained model to a production environment using Railway.

## Live Application

You can access the live application deployed on Railway [here](https://appmlopstitanic-production.up.railway.app/).

## Features

- **Automated Workflows**: Utilizing CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment process.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring the application can handle increased load and data.
- **Monitoring**: Implementing monitoring tools to track the performance and health of the deployed model.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the setup guide.

We hope you find this project useful and informative. Happy coding!
